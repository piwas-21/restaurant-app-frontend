# Cashier Page Implementation Plan

## Overview
Complete cashier interface for managing orders in real-time, updating order details, processing payments, and managing order lifecycle.

## Features & Capabilities

### Core Features
1. **Real-time Order Management**
   - Display all active orders fetched from backend
   - Real-time order updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   - Auto-refresh order list and details
   - Handle connection loss gracefully with fallback polling

2. **Order Viewing & Filtering**
   - View all orders with pagination
   - Filter by order status (Pending, Confirmed, Preparing, Ready, etc.)
   - Filter by payment status (Pending, Completed, PartiallyPaid, etc.)
   - Filter by order type (DineIn, Takeaway, Delivery)
   - Search by order number or customer name
   - Sort by order date, priority

3. **Order Details Panel**
   - Customer information (name, email, phone)
   - Order items with quantities and prices
   - Order type and table number (if dine-in)
   - Delivery address (if delivery)
   - Special instructions/notes
   - Order totals (subtotal, tax, delivery fee, discount, total)
   - Payment information and remaining amount

4. **Order Status Management**
   - Update order status with validation
   - Status workflow: Pending → Confirmed → Preparing → Ready → Completed
   - Alternative: Cancel order with confirmation
   - Refund capability for cancelled orders
   - Mark orders as focus/priority with custom reason

5. **Item Management** ⚠️ **LIMITATION**
   - View all items in order
   - **Note:** Backend doesn't provide item add/remove/update endpoints
   - Recommendation: Create new backend commands for item management, OR create a note system for order modifications

6. **Payment Management**
   - View all payments on order
   - Add new payment with method selection
   - View payment details (amount, method, status, date)
   - Process refunds (full or partial)
   - Update payment status
   - Calculate remaining balance

7. **Order Type Changes** ⚠️ **CRITICAL LIMITATION**
   - **CANNOT change order type after creation** (backend limitation)
   - Tax is calculated once at order creation and cannot be recalculated
   - If customer requests change: Document in notes, or suggest creating new order
   - **Decision needed:** Should we create backend endpoint for order type changes with tax recalculation?

8. **Design & UX**
   - Match app's design system (RUMI Red, CSS variables, dark/light mode)
   - Responsive layout for desktop (cashier uses desktop)
   - Multi-column layout: order list + order details
   - Action buttons with clear icons and labels
   - Status badges with appropriate colors
   - Real-time visual updates

9. **Multi-language Support**
   - All UI text translated using i18next
   - Support: English, German, Turkish, Italian, Arabic, French, Spanish
   - Dynamic language switching

10. **Additional Considerations**
    - Confirm destructive actions (cancel, refund, status changes)
    - Show success/error notifications for all actions
    - Log all cashier actions (created orders, payments, refunds, status changes)
    - Role-based access control (Cashier role only)
    - Handle concurrent updates (multiple cashiers)
    - Error handling and fallback states

## Backend Limitations & Workarounds

| Limitation | Workaround |
|-----------|-----------|
| Cannot change order type after creation | Add note about requested change, suggest new order, OR create new backend endpoint |
| Cannot add/remove/update items after creation | Create item management backend commands OR use order notes system |
| Tax is immutable after creation | Inform cashier during order placement or note system |
| No generic order field updates | Use specific endpoints (status, payments, focus) |
| SSE in-memory (lost on server restart) | Implement polling fallback every 10 seconds |
| No payment gateway integration | Manual payment status updates by cashier |

## Estimated Effort
- Phase 1: 4-5 hours
- Phase 2: 3-4 hours
- Phase 3: 3-4 hours

- **Total: ~20-25 hours**

## Notes

1. **Order Type Changes**: Backend limitation means order type cannot be changed after creation. Consider adding this feature to backend if needed.

2. **Item Modifications**: Backend doesn't support adding/removing/updating items. Consider either:
   - Creating backend endpoints for item management
   - Using order notes system for modifications
   - Suggesting new order for changes

3. **SSE Connection**: Implement heartbeat detection and auto-reconnect on disconnect

4. **Concurrent Updates**: Multiple cashiers may modify same order - implement optimistic locking or version checks

5. **Performance**: With many orders, use virtual scrolling in order list

6. **Mobile**: Cashier primarily uses desktop, but design should be tablet-friendly as fallback
